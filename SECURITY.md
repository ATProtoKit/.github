# Security Policy

## Version Support
Currently, the latest version of the repository supports security vulnerability reports. For example, if the latest version of `ATProtoKit` is 0.19.4, then only version 0.19.4 can be reported, as the security issues prior to that may have already been resolved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
