<h1 align="center">The ATProtoKit Project</h1>

This is the official repository for ATProtoKit and its family of projects, including forks and semi-related projects that help ATProtoKit work. The goal is to create a fully Swift implementation of the AT Protocol, Bluesky, and any other services built on top of the protocol. The intention is to interoperate with the official TypeScript and Go implementations of the protocol.

With the exception of the main ATProtoKit repository and any forks, all repositories in the project are licensed under Apache 2.0. In order to comply with the licence, all you need to do is attach the licence and mention the existence of the package(s) in your Credits or Contributions page. If youâ€™re using the Swift Package Manager or some other manager that pulls in the code, the first part should already be compliant.

> **Note**: Even though the main ATProtoKit repository is under the MIT licence, please do consider also crediting the Swift package.

This is a work-in-progress and many things may break or not work. Contributions and donations are welcome!
